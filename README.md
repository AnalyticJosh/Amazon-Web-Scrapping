# Amazon Web Scraping Project

## **Overview**

This project demonstrates the use of Python for web scraping Amazon product data. It collects information about products, including names, prices, ratings, and reviews, to analyze trends and identify patterns in e-commerce.

## **Objectives**

- Extract product data from Amazon's website using web scraping techniques.
- Analyze prices, ratings, and customer reviews for insights.
- Identify trends in product categories and pricing strategies.

## **Key Features**

- **Data Extraction**: Scrapes product names, prices, ratings, and review counts.
- **Data Cleaning**: Processes raw scraped data for consistency and accuracy.
- **Visualization**: Creates charts to represent pricing trends and customer feedback.
- **Categorical Analysis**: Examines product categories for market trends.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Python**: Main language for web scraping and analysis.
- **Libraries**:
  - `BeautifulSoup`: For parsing HTML content.
  - `Requests`: For sending HTTP requests.
  - `Pandas`: For data cleaning and manipulation.
  - `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`: For data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for coding and exploration.

## **Dataset Information**

- The dataset includes:
  - Product names and categories.
  - Prices and availability.
  - Ratings and review counts.

## **Steps to Reproduce**

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AnalyticJosh/Amazon-Web-Scrapping.git
   cd Amazon-Web-Scrapping
   ```

2. **Set Up the Environment**:

   - Ensure Python (3.7 or higher) is installed.
   - Install required libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Run the Notebook**:

   - Open `Amazon Web Scraper Project.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
   - Execute cells sequentially to scrape, clean, and analyze data.

4. **Note**:

   - Scraping Amazon’s website may require headers or proxies to avoid detection.
   - Ensure compliance with Amazon’s terms of service when scraping data.

## **Sample Analysis**

### Average Price by Category

```python
average_price = data.groupby('Category')['Price'].mean()
average_price.plot(kind='bar', title='Average Price by Category')
plt.show()
```

### Rating Distribution

```python
sns.histplot(data['Rating'], bins=10, kde=True)
plt.title('Distribution of Product Ratings')
plt.show()
```

## **Results and Insights**

- Key findings:
  - Category A products have the highest average price.
  - Products with ratings above 4.5 tend to receive the highest review counts.
  - Seasonal pricing trends show increased costs during holidays.
- Suggested strategies:
  - Focus on high-rated products for marketing campaigns.
  - Monitor seasonal pricing to optimize inventory and sales.

## **Visualizations**

- **Price Distribution**: Histogram and box plot of product prices.
- **Category Analysis**: Bar chart showing average price and review count by category.
- **Rating Trends**: Line chart of average ratings over time.
